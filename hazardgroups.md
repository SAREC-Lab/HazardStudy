We have created 8 different hazard trees each related to a specific area of UAV safety 



__HG1: Collisions between multiple UAVs, or UAVs and other objects__
[[Hazard Tree]](human-interaction-hazards/collisions.md)

Hazards related to collisions between multiple UAVs and/or UAVs and other objects.  These hazards occur when a UAV flies too close to the ground or loses geolocation so that it crashes into the ground or buildings.  Ground-based collisions can also occur when an operator assumes manual control during the mission without full situational awareness or without skills to operator the UAV.  Finally, hazards occur when multiple UAVs crash into each other in midair.
