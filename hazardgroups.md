We have created 8 different hazard trees each related to a specific area of UAV safety 



__HG1: Collisions between multiple UAVs, or UAVs and other objects__
[[Hazard Tree]](human-interaction-hazards/collisions.md)

Collisions must be avoided between multiple UAVs, UAVs and other objects, and UAVs and the terrain. Collisions occur when a UAV flies too close to the ground or loses geolocation so that it crashes into the ground or buildings.  They can also occur when an operator assumes manual control during the mission without having full situational awareness of the UAV or without correct skills to operate the UAV.  Finally, midair collisions occur when UAVs collide in flight.

__HG2: Loss of communication with the UAV__
[[Hazard Tree]](human-interaction-hazards/collisions.md)

One of the most common causes of accidents with UAVs is caused by loss-of-signal preventing the remote pilot (RPIC) from sending commands to the UAV or receiving status updates. RPICs communicate with their UAV by sending commands through a hand-held-controller (i.e., throttle, forward, backward, sideways, turn) or through use of a computer system (e.g., MissionPlanner, QGroundControl, or custom built software) operating over an alternate communication technique or frequency. Hazard mitigations are dependent upon the operating context -- specifically whether redundant communication paths exist, and whether the loss of signal is caused by a fault on the UAV or a communication failure.

__HG3: Hardware and sensors__
[[Hazard Tree]](human-interaction-hazards/sensors.md)

Hardware and sensor failures can cause numerous problems in the UAV's behavior. Failures can occur with diverse components such as propellers, transmitters, autopilots, batteries and connectors, GPS units, cameras, parachutes and more.
